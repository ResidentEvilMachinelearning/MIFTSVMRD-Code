This package is a MATLAB implementation of ["Handling Multi-Class Problem by Intuitionistic Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machines Based on
Relative Density Information"]. You can train the M-IFTSVM-RD model on your dataset for multi-classification problems.

The M-IFTSVM-RD approximates the probability density distribution in multi-dimensional continuous space by computing the K-nearest-neighbor distance of each training sample.

# Usage Instructions

In matlab, run M-IFTSVM-RD.m.



# Additional Information


You need to optimize the parameter first, then run the code for the optimized parameter. Also, for different datasets, you need to change the number of classes.

For the final result should consider MaxAcc.

ATTN1: These packages are free for academic usage. You can run them at your own risk. For other
purposes.
