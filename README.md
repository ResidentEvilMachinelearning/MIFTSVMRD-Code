This package is a MATLAB implementation of ["Handling Multi-Class Problem by Intuitionistic Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machines Based on
Relative Density Information", Salim Rezvani and Junhao Wu]. You can train M-IFTSVM-RD model on your dataset for multi classification problems.

The M-IFTSVM-RD approximates the probability density distribution in multi-dimensional continuous space by computing the K-nearest-neighbor distance of each training sample.

# Usage Instructions

In matlab, run M-IFTSVM-RD.m.



# Additional Information

For any questions and comments, please send your email to junhwu@stu.edu.cn.

You need to optimize the parameter first, then run the code for the optimized parameter. Also, for different datasets, you need to change the number of classes.

For the final result should considered MaxAcc.

ATTN1: This packages are free for academic usage. You can run them at your own risk. For other
purposes, (junhwu@stu.edu.cn).
