This package is a MATLAB implementation of ["Handling Multi-Class Problem by Intuitionistic Fuzzy Twin Support Vector Machines Based on
Relative Density Information"]. You can train the M-IFTSVM-RD model on your dataset for multi-classification problems.

The M-IFTSVM-RD approximates the probability density distribution in multi-dimensional continuous space by computing the K-nearest-neighbor distance of each training sample.

# Usage Instructions

In matlab, run M-IFTSVM-RD.m.



# Additional Information


You need to optimize the parameter first, then run the code for the optimized parameter. 

For the final result, you should consider MaxAcc.

ATTN1: These packages are free for academic usage. You can run them at your own risk. For other
purposes.
